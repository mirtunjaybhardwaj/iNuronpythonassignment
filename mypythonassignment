## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans. Because they are not written in machine-readable language, Python programs need to be processed before machines can run them. Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code.
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans. Python is a dynamically typed language. It doesn’t know about the type of the variable until the code is run. So declaration is of no use. What it does is, It stores that value at some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container. And makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name. So the data type does not matter. As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time.
Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans. Pros-- Python is easy to learn and read,Python enhances productivity, Python has a vast collection of libraries, Python is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community, Python is a portable programming language, Python is an interpreted language
Cons--Python has speed limitations, Python is not so strong with mobile computing, Python can have runtime errors, Python consumes a lot of memory space, Python is not easy to test
Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans. AI & Machine Learning, Application Development, Automation, Data Science
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans. Variables are those who variates any value. Any variable name should start with alphabet. If we want to store the things we need variables like- age, name, class. Means name given to a memory location. It stores an item but whenever we do any type of modificationn to that it variates. We can not use any special symbol in variable. We can use only character and _ symbol.
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans. We can use input function to take an input from the user in Python
Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans. By default input function returns a string. So the name and age will be stored as strings.
Q8. What is type casting?
Ans. The concept of type casting is that to change the data type from one to another. Like int to float or float to int.
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans. No we can’t take more than one input from user using single input() function because if we take more than one input then we need to use another function with it. 
Q10. What are keywords?
Ans. Keywords is a type of python tokkens. Keywords are reserves special words that can not be used for other purpose. ex- false,True, or,as,return while etc.
Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans. We can not use keywords as a variable. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language. All the keywords except True , False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as they are
Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. Python indentation is a way of telling a Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of code. If we miss the proper indentation then it will send a error .
Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans. When we use any type of operation we used operators.
There are 3 types of operators-
1.Arithmatic Operators 2. Logical operators 3. Relational operators
Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans. / used for devision and // used for integer division only.
Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans. mypython_assignment = "iNuron" * 4
print("mypython_assignment = ", mypython_assignment)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans. num= int(input("enter a number = "))
if (num % 2)==0:
    print("number is even")
else:
    print("number is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans. That performs only binary functions ex- True and False.
Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0
Ans. 1
0 and 0
Ans. 0
True and False and True
Ans. False
1 or 0 or 0
Ans. 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans. A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program. Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you should know like- if, else, elif. Conditional statements are those statements who used to take the decision, in other words conditional statements are called decision making statements. 
Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans. We can use if,else and elif in conditional statement or in decision making. Like we can use if and else in the condition where we need to take the decisions like –if any certain condition meets else another condition. And for elif- when we need to use nested if-else then we will use elif.
Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans. age=int(input("enter age = "))
if age>=18:
    print("I can vote")
elif age<=18:
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans. numbers = [12,75,150,180,145,525,50]
list_num=0
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        list_num=list_num+num
print(list_num)
++


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans. a=100
b=30
c=50
if (a>b) and (a>c):
    print("a is greater")
elif (b>a) and (b>c):
    print("b is geater")
else :
    print("c is greater")





Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five
- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans.
numbers = [12,75,150,180,145,525,50]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 5 ==0:
        if num > 150:
            if num > 500:
                print("print the remaining number=",num)
                break
